# color-rush
Color Rush is a game of perception and speed, based on color reproduction. It is a university project created in the framework of the "Digital Imaging" teaching of my Bachelor of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
## Rules
At each level, you have a limited amount of time to reproduce a color using sliders. But the time allowed gets shorter as you advance to higher levels.

At the end of the time limit, the distance between the color you created and the color you should have created will be computed. 
To access the next level, this distance must be lower than 20%. So the colors must look at least 80% alike.
